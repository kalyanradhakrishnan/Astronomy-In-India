Dear Viewer,

We welcome you to this website. The aim of the webpage is to provide you information regarding Astronomy in India. All info in one page is the idea. We will try to provide you everything we can and also update whenever we can. However, in reality, this may not be possible. Therefore, if you have any input, feel free to contact us. Thanks and enjoy. 

We express our sincere gratitude to each and everyone who have contributed to this webapge in the form of providing information, designing this webpage, etc.

## Ideas

Listing some of the ideas in mind. Each of these need to be expanded.

1. Master programs
2. PhD programs
3. PostDoc programs
4. Astronomy institutes
5. instrumentation in india - ground-based, space-based, x-ray, uv-, visible-, nir-, fir, radio-, solar, etc.
6. space-missions - past, present, and future
7. telescopes in india - optical, optical+infrared, radio, solar
8. observing possibilities
9. computational facilities
10. international collaborations - TMT, LIGO, etc.
11. PhD ad
12. PostDoc ad
13. events - workshops, conferences
14. internship opportunities
15. outreach - astronomy for school children, public, etc.
16. history of Indian Astronomy
17. Other useful useful links - NYRIA, AAS register, RAS register, women in astronomy, acknowledgement generator, etc.
18. Where can I buy a telescope? How much will it cost? and what all I can see using the telescope?

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
